   <h1>Disruptive behavior disorders</h1>
   <h2>Oppositional Defiant Disorder(ODD)</h2>
   <p>Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a condition in which your child displays a pattern of uncooperative, defiant and angry behavior toward people in authority. ODD is treatable with psychotherapy and parent management training.</p>
   <h2>What is Oppositional Defiant Disorder?</h2>
   <p>ODD is a behavior condition in which your child displays a continuing pattern of uncooperative, defiant and sometimes hostile behavior toward people in authority. This behavior often disrupts your child’s normal daily functioning, including relationships and activities within their family and at school.</p>
   <p>It’s common for children — especially those two to three years old and in their early teens — to be oppositional or defiant of authority once in a while. They might express their defiance by arguing, disobeying or talking back to adults, including their parents or teachers. When this behavior lasts longer than six months and goes beyond what’s usual for your child’s age, it might suggest that they have ODD.</p>

<p>The majority of children and teens who have ODD also have at least one other mental health condition, including:
<br><li><a href="Attention-deficit hyperactivity/Disorder(ADHD)">Attention-deficit hyperactivity/Disorder(ADHD)</a></li>
<li><a href="Anxiety Disorder">Anxiety Disorder</a> including obsessive-compulsive disorder</li>
<li><a href="Learning differences">Learning differences</a></li>
<li><a href="Mood disorders">Mood disorders</a></li>
<li><a href="Impulse control disorder">Impulse control disorder</a></li></p>
<p>About 30% of children with ODD develop a more serious behavior condition called conduct disorder. ODD behaviors can continue into adulthood if ODD isn’t properly diagnosed and treated.</p>
<h2>What is Conduct Disorder?</h2>
<p>Conduct Disorder is a condition in which your child or adolescent shows an ongoing pattern of aggression toward others. They also show serious violations of rules and social norms at home, in school and with peers.</p>
<p>Children with CD are more likely to get injured and may have difficulties getting along with peers.

<br>Signs of conduct disorder include:
<li>Frequently breaking serious rules, such as running away from home, staying out at night when told not to or skipping school.</li>
<li>Being aggressive in a way that causes harm, such as bullying, fighting or being cruel to animals.</li>
<li>Lying, stealing or damaging other people’s property on purpose.</li></p>
<h2>Who does oppositional defiant disorder affect?</h2>
<p>ODD most commonly affects children and teenagers, but it can also affect adults. It most commonly begins by age 8.

<br>Some children outgrow ODD or receive proper treatment for it, while others continue to have symptoms through adulthood.</p>

<p>Children assigned male at birth (AMAB) are more likely to have ODD in their younger years than children assigned female at birth (AFAB). But teenagers who were AMAB and AFAB are affected equally.</p>
Your child is more likely to develop ODD if they have the following risk factors:

<li>A history of child abuse or neglect.</li>
<li>A parent or caregiver who has a mood disorder or who has substance or alcohol use disorders.</li>
<li>Exposure to violence.</li>
<li>Inconsistent discipline and lack of adult supervision.</li>
<li>Instability in their family, such as divorce, moving to different houses often and changing schools frequently.</li>
<li>Financial problems in their family.</li>
<li>Parents who have or have had ODD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or behavioral problems.</li>
<h2>How common is oppositional defiant disorder?</h2>
<p>Researchers estimate that oppositional defiant disorder affects 2% to 11% of children.
<br> This range is so wide because some children may be misdiagnosed as having conduct disorder, and teenagers, as a population, are often underdiagnosed.
<br>The prevalence of ODD declines with increasing age.</p>
<h2>What are the signs and symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)?</h2>
<p>Signs and symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder usually begin by age 8. Symptoms usually remain stable between the ages of 5 and 10 and typically, but not always, decline afterward.</p>

<p>The symptoms are often apparent in multiple settings but may be more noticeable at home or school.</p>

Signs and symptoms of ODD can be grouped into three categories:

<li>Anger and irritability.</li>
<li>Argumentative and defiant behavior.</li>
<li>Vindictiveness.</li>
In addition, many children with ODD are moody, easily frustrated and have low self-esteem. They also might misuse drugs and alcohol.
<h2>How is oppositional defiant disorder treated?</h2>
<p>Treatment for ODD varies based on many factors, including:

<li>Your child’s age.</li>
<li>The severity of their symptoms.</li>
<li>Your child’s ability to take part in and tolerate it specific therapies.</li>
<li>If your child has other conditions, such as ADHD, learning differences and/or OCD.</li>
<li>Treatment of ODD should involve your child, your family and their school.</li>

Treatment usually consists of a combination of the following:

Parent management training (PMT).
Psychotherapy (talk therapy).
School-based interventions.</p>
