            <h1>Depression</h1>

            <p>Depression is a common mental health condition that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and changes in how you think, sleep, eat and act. There are several different types. Depression is treatable usually with talk therapy, medication or both. Seeking medical help as soon as you have symptoms is essential.</p>
            
            <h2>What is Depression?</h2>

            <p>Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in things and activities you once enjoyed. It can also cause difficulty with thinking, memory, eating and sleeping.

                It’s normal to feel sad about or grieve over difficult life situations, such as losing your job or a divorce. But depression is different in that it persists practically every day for at least two weeks and involves other symptoms than sadness alone.
                
                There are several types of depressive disorders. Clinical depression, or major depressive disorder, is often just called “depression.” It’s the most severe type of depression.
                
                Without treatment, depression can get worse and last longer. In severe cases, it can lead to self-harm or death by suicide. The good news is that treatments can be very effective in improving symptoms.
            </p>

            <h2>What causes depression?</h2>

            <p>Researchers don’t know the exact cause of depression. They think that several factors contribute to its development, including:
            <ul>
                <li> chemistry: An imbalance of neurotransmitters, including serotonin and dopamine, contributes to the development of depression.</li>
                <li>Genetics: If you have a first-degree relative (biological parent or sibling) with depression, you’re about three times as likely to develop the condition as the general population. However, you can have depression without a family history of it.</li>
                <li>Stressful life events: Difficult experiences, such as the death of a loved one, trauma, divorce, isolation and lack of support, can trigger depression.</li>
                <li>Medical conditions: Chronic pain and chronic conditions like diabetes can lead to depression.</li>
                <li>Medication: Some medications can cause depression as a side effect. Substance use, including alcohol, can also cause depression or make it worse.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>What are the symptoms of depression?</h2>

            <p>The symptoms of depression can vary slightly depending on the type and can range from mild to severe. In general, symptoms include:
            <ul>
                <li>Feeling very sad, hopeless or worried. Children and adolescents with depression may be irritable rather than sad.</li>
                <li>Not enjoying things that used to bring joy.</li>
                <li>Being easily irritated or frustrated.</li>
                <li>Eating too much or too little, which may result in weight gain or weight loss.</li>
                <li>Trouble sleeping (insomnia) or sleeping too much (hypersomnia).</li>
                <li>Having low energy or fatigue.</li>
                <li>Having a difficult time concentrating, making decisions or remembering things.</li>
                <li>Experiencing physical issues like headache, stomachache or sexual dysfunction.</li>
                <li>Having thoughts of self-harm or suicide.</li>
                <p>f you or a loved one are thinking about suicide, dial 988 on your phone to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Someone will be available to help you 24/7.</p>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>How is depression diagnosed?</h2>

            <p>Healthcare providers diagnose depression based on a thorough understanding of your symptoms, medical history and mental health history. They may diagnose you with a specific type of depression, such as seasonal affective disorder or postpartum depression, based on the context of your symptoms.

                To receive a diagnosis of depression, you must have five depression symptoms every day, nearly all day, for at least two weeks.
                
                Your provider may order medical tests, such as blood tests, to see if any underlying medical conditions are causing your depressive symptoms.
            </p>

            <h2>How is depression treated?</h2>

            <p>Depression is one of the most treatable mental health conditions. Approximately 80% to 90% of people with depression who seek treatment eventually respond well to treatment.

                Treatment options include:
            <ul>
            <li>Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy (talk therapy) involves talking with a mental health professional. Your therapist helps you identify and change unhealthy emotions, thoughts and behaviors. There are many types of psychotherapy — cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most common. Sometimes, brief therapy is all you need. Other people continue therapy for several months or years.</li>
            <li>Medication: Prescription medicine called antidepressants can help change the brain chemistry that causes depression. There are several different types of antidepressants, and it may take time to figure out the one that’s best for you. Some antidepressants have side effects, which often improve with time. If they don’t, talk to your healthcare provider. A different medication may work better for you.</li>
            <li>Complementary medicine: This involves treatments you may receive along with traditional Western medicine. People with mild depression or ongoing symptoms can improve their well-being with therapies such as acupuncture, massage, hypnosis and biofeedback.</li>
            <li>Brain stimulation therapy: Brain stimulation therapy can help people who have severe depression or depression with psychosis. Types of brain stimulation therapy include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).</li>
                
            <p><b>There are also things you can do at home to help improve depression symptoms, including:</b></p>
                
            <li>Getting regular exercise.</li>
            <li>Getting quality sleep (not too little or too much).</li>
            <li>Eating a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>Avoiding alcohol, which is a depressant.</li>
            <li>Spending time with people you care about.</li>
            </ul>
