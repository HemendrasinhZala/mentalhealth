            <h1>Schizophrenia</h1>

            <p>Schizophrenia involves a disconnection from reality, including hallucinations and delusions. It also affects your ability to recognize your symptoms. It’s a severe condition, but it’s treatable.</p>

            <h2>What is schizophrenia?</h2>

            <p>Schizophrenia is a psychiatric condition that has severe effects on your physical and mental well-being. It disrupts how your brain works, interfering with things like your thoughts, memory, senses and behaviors. As a result, you may struggle in many parts of your day-to-day life. Untreated schizophrenia often disrupts your relationships (professional, social, romantic and otherwise). It can also cause you to have trouble organizing your thoughts, and you might behave in ways that put you at risk for injuries or other illnesses.</p>

            <h2>What causes schizophrenia?</h2>

            <p><ul>There’s no one single cause of schizophrenia. Experts suspect schizophrenia happens for different reasons. The three main reasons include:

            <li>Imbalances in chemical signals your brain uses for cell-to-cell communication.</li>
            <li>Brain development problems before birth.</li>
            <li>Loss of connections between different areas of your brain.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>What are the five symptoms of schizophrenia?</h2>

            <p>Many people with schizophrenia can’t recognize that they have symptoms of schizophrenia. But those around you might. These are the five main symptoms of schizophrenia

                <ol>
                <li>Delusions: These are false beliefs that you hold even when there’s plenty of evidence that those beliefs are wrong. For example, you might think that someone is controlling what you think, say or do.</li>
                <li>Hallucinations: You still think you can see, hear, smell, touch or taste things that don’t exist, like hearing voices.</li>
                <li>Disorganized or incoherent speaking: You may have trouble organizing your thoughts while speaking. This might look like trouble staying on topic, or your thoughts might be so jumbled that people can’t understand you.</li>
                <li>Disorganized or unusual movements: You might move differently than people around you expect. For example, you may turn around a lot for no clear reason, or you might not move much at all.</li>
                <li>Negative symptoms: These refer to a reduction or loss of your ability to do things as expected. For example, you might stop making facial expressions, or speak with a flat, emotionless voice. Negative symptoms also include a lack of motivation, especially when you don’t want to socialize or do things you ordinarily enjoy.</li>
                </ol>
                Because of these symptoms, you might:
                <ul>               
                <li>Feel suspicious, paranoid or scared.</li>
                <li>Not care about your hygiene and appearance.</li>
                <li>Experience depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.</li>
                <li>Use alcohol, nicotine, prescription medications or recreational drugs to try to ease your symptoms.</li>          
                </p>
                </ul>

                <h2>How is schizophrenia treated?</h2>

                <p>Treating schizophrenia usually involves a combination of medication, therapy and self-management techniques. These include:
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Antipsychotics.</b> These medications block how your brain uses certain chemicals for cell-to-cell communication.</li>
                    <li><b>Other medications.</b> Your healthcare provider might also prescribe other medications to symptoms that happen alongside or because of your schizophrenia symptoms. They might also prescribe medications to help reduce side effects of antipsychotic medications such as tremors.</li>
                    <li><b>psychotherapy.</b> Talk therapy methods like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you cope with and manage your condition. Long-term therapy can also help with secondary problems alongside schizophrenia, such as anxiety, depression or substance use issues.</li>
                    <li><b>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).</b> If other treatments don’t work, your provider may recommend ECT. This treatment involves using an electrical current applied to your scalp, which then stimulates certain parts of your brain. The stimulation causes a brief seizure, which can help improve brain function if you have severe depression, agitation and other problems. If you have ECT, you receive anesthesia. You’ll be asleep for this procedure and won’t feel any pain.</li>
                    </ul>
