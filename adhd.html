  <h1>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</h1>  
<p>ADHD is one of the most common childhood neurodevelopmental disorders. Children with ADHD often have difficulty with inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Kids usually receive a diagnosis during childhood and this condition often lasts into adulthood.</p>
<h2>What is ADHD?</h2>
<p>It is one of the most studied neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Scientists have discovered there are differences in brains,nerve networks and neurotransmitters of people with ADHD.</p>
<p>ADHD is a long term brain condition that causes <a href="#">executive</a><a href="#">dysfunction</a>which means it disrupts a person's ability to manage their own emotions and actions.<br>ADHD makes it difficult for people to:</p>
1)Manage their behaviour
<br>2)Pay attention
<br>3)Control overactivity
<br>4)Regulate their mood
<br>5)Stay organized
<br>6)Concentrate
<br>7)Follow directions
<p>Children usually receive a diagnosis during childhood and the condition often lasts into adulthood. Children left untreated can cause serious lifelong complications.</p>
<h2>How common is ADHD?</h2>
<p>According to the Centres of Disease Control and Prevention, worldwide 7.2% children have received an ADHD diagnosis.</p>
<p>Boys and children assigned male at birth (AMAB) receive an ADHD diagnosis more than twice as often as girls and children assigned female at birth (AFAB). It means that boys and children assigned male at birth (AMAB) are present more often with hyperactive-type symptoms and are therefore easier to diagnose.</p>
<h2>Types of ADHD</h2>
<p>There are four types of ADHD symptoms:
<br>1)Predominantly inattentive presentation
<br>2)Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation
<br>3)Combined presentation
<br>4)Unspecified presentation</p>
<h3>1)Predominantly inattentive presentation</h3>
<p>Children with predominantly inattentive presentation mainly have difficulty in focusing, organizing and staying on track and have fewer hyperactivity or impulsivity symptoms.
Providers previously called this Attention Deficit-disorder(ADD)</p>
<h3>2)Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation</h3>
<p>Children with this presentation show issues with hyperactivity and impulsivity and may show less trouble with paying attention. 
<br>Hyperactivity means they may can’t sit still, have a lot of excess energy and are extremely talkative.
<br>Impulsivity means they may interrupt others and act without thinking it through first. This typically affects the younger children.</p>
<h3>3)Combined presentation </h3>
<p>Children with this presentation show at least six symptoms from both of the other types. Symptoms of inattentiveness and hyperactivity-impulsivity present equally. This is the type which people most commonly associate with ADHD. About 70% of cases fall under this type.</p>
<h3>4) Unspecified presentation </h3>
<p>Symptoms may be so severe that children clearly demonstrate dysfunction but don’t meet official symptom criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive or combined type. In such cases, providers assign “unspecified ADHD” as the diagnosis.</p>
<h2>What are the symptoms of ADHD?</h2>
<p>The provider will make a diagnosis based on the presence and absence of certain symptoms. The symptoms must have interfered with functioning at the areas of life have occurred for at least the past six months.
<br>The signs of ADHD to diagnose and determine the type of condition is inattentive, hyperactivity/impulsivity, combined or unspecified condition.</p>
<h3>Predominantly inattentive presentation</h3>
<p>A child with this type of condition must display at least six of the following nine behaviors:
<br>1)Trouble in paying attention or making careless mistakes.
<br>2)Difficult to remain focused on tasks and activities.
<br>3)Difficulty listening well or getting distracted.
<br>4)Trouble with following instructions or finishing tasks.
<br>5)Difficulty with organizing tasks and activities.
<br>6)Avoiding or disliking tasks that require continuous mental effort.
<br>7)Losing things frequently.
<br>8)Easily distracted by outside.
<br>9)Forgetful in daily activities.</p>
<h3>Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation </h3>
<p>A child must display at least six of the following eight behaviours.
<br>1)Fidgeting or tapping hands or feet or squirming frequently.
<br>2)Running or climbing when it’s not appropriate.
<br>3)Trouble in playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly.
<br>4)Always seeming “on the go” or “driven by a motor.”
<br>5)Talking too much.
<br>6)Blurting out answers before questions are completed.
<br>7)Frequent trouble waiting for their turn.
<br>8)Often interrupting or intruding on others conversations or games.
</p>
<h3>Combined presentation</h3>
<p>People with combined type display behaviors from both inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive categories.
<br>Children must display at least 12 of the total behaviors </p>
<h2>What causes ADHD?</h2>
<p>Scientists have identified differences in the brain structure and activity of people with ADHD. The <a href="frontal lobe">frontal lobe</a> is the front part of your brain, the part behind your forehead. It is responsible for planning, paying attention and making decisions. The brains of people with ADHD tend to reach their full maturity at a later time than those of neurotypical people. Researcher called this kind of activity directed attention.</p>
<p>People use directed attention to suspend automatic attention, which is very strong in people with ADHD.In a person with ADHD, directed attention skills tend to be weaker.
<br>Directed attention is the kind of attention you use when you must do something that’s tiring or of low interest.
<br>Automatic attention is the kind of attention you use when you’re doing something that’s interesting or engaging.</p>
<p>Although researchers have discovered these brain differences, they don’t completely understand why they occur and lead to symptoms of ADHD. But current research shows that genetics plays a vital role. ADHD often runs in families — a child with ADHD has a 1 in 4 chance of having a parent with the condition.</p>
<p>Other possible causes for ADHD are:
<br>•Lead exposure
<br>•Brain anatomy
<br>•<a href="#">Substance use during pregnancy</a>
<br>•<a href="#">Premature birth</a></p>
The following aren’t causes of ADHD:

<br>•Allergies
<br>•Immunizations
<br>•Eating too much sugar
<br>•Too much time staring at screens
<br>•Poor parenting
Social factors such as poverty
<h2>What are the complications of ADHD?</h2>
<p>Without treatment, ADHD can lead to a number of complications. These complications may include:

<ul>
    <li>Poor self-esteem.</li>
<li>Depression and anxiety.</li>
<li>Eating disorders.</li>
<li>Sleep issues.</li>
<li>Substance use disorder.</li>
<li>Risky, impulsive behaviors.</li>
<li>Frequent driving accidents and injuries.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>How is ADHD treated?</h2>
<p>The goal of ADHD treatment is to improve your child’s symptoms so they can function more effectively at home and school. For younger children (ages 4 and 5), providers recommend intervention for parents as the first line of treatment before medication is tried.

In most cases, the best ADHD treatment for older children, adolescents and adults includes a combination of behavioral therapy and ADHD medication.</p>
