    <h2>How are mental health disorders diagnosed?</h2>
    <p>
        It’s important to get a diagnosis from a healthcare provider who specializes in behavioral health disorders.
        You need an accurate diagnosis to receive the right treatment.
    <br>
        A healthcare provider will carefully review your symptoms to evaluate your mental health.
        Be sure to tell your healthcare provider:
        <ul>
            <li>If there are any specific triggers that make your mental health worse.</li>
            <li>If your mental health problems are chronic (ongoing) or if they come and go.</li>
            <li>When you first noticed changes in your mental health.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        There aren’t any medical tests that can diagnose mental illnesses. 
        But your healthcare provider may perform tests, such as blood work or imaging exams, to rule out other conditions that can affect mental health.
    </p>
    <h2>How are mental health disorders treated?</h2>
    <p>
        Treatments for mental health disorders may include:
        <li>Medication: Some mental illnesses respond well to medication, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics. 
        These medicines change the chemicals in your brain, so you experience fewer symptoms.
        It’s very important to take medication exactly as your healthcare provider directs. 
        Never stop taking medication for a mental illness without consulting your healthcare provider.</li>
