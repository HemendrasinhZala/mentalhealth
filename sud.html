            <h2>What is substance use disorder?</h2>
            
            <p>Substance use disorder (SUD) is a mental health condition in which a person has a problematic pattern of substance use that causes distress and/or impairs their life.

SUD exists on a spectrum and may be mild, moderate or severe. It typically involves an overpowering desire to use the substance, increased tolerance to the substance and/or withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking the substance.

A person can have more than one substance use disorder at a time, such as alcohol use disorder and cocaine use disorder.

Substance use disorder can significantly impact your health, relationships and overall quality of life. It can also be life-threatening. It’s crucial to seek help as soon as you develop signs of SUD.</p>

<li>Occasional use (or using prescriptions not as directed).</li>
<li>Heavy use.</li>
<li>Substance use disorder.</li>
</ul>
