<h1>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h1>

<h2>What is Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease typically diagnosed during childhood. The former name of ASD is autism, and many people still use the term. But ASD includes several conditions within the spectrum. ASD changes the way your child interacts and communicates. There’s no cure for autism, but the symptoms may lessen over time.
</p>

<h2>What causes autism?</h2>

<p>There’s no clear-cut cause of ASD. Research supports genetic and environmental factors as some causes of autism. Scientists believe there could be many different causes of ASD that act together to change the ways people develop. They still have a lot to learn about the causes and how they impact people with ASD.
</p>
<h1>Symtoms</h1>

<p>Autism symptoms range from mild to severely disabling, and every person is different. You should consider the following signs of autism as possible indicators that your child may be at risk for the condition. If your child shows any of the following early signs of autism, get in touch with their healthcare provider. They may recommend a referral for an autism evaluation.

Signs of autism include difficulties with social interactions, such as:
<ul>
<li>Your child doesn’t look at you when you call their name or responds inconsistently.</li>
<li>Your baby doesn’t smile widely or make warm, joyful expressions by the age of 6 months.</li>
<li>Your baby doesn’t engage in smiling, making sounds and making faces with you or other people by the age of 9 months.</li>
<li>Your baby doesn’t babble by the age of 12 months.</li>
<li>Your baby doesn’t use gestures such as reaching or waving by the age of 12 months.<li>
<li>Your baby doesn’t play any back-and-forth games, like “peek-a-boo,” by the age of 12 months.</li>
<li>Your toddler doesn’t say any words by the age of 16 months.</li>
<li>Your toddler doesn’t speak any meaningful, two-word phrases (not including imitating or repeating) by the age of 24 months.</li>
<li>Any loss of speech, babbling or social skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Signs of autism also include specific behaviors, called restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your child often lines up toys or plays with toys the same way every time.</li>
<li>Your child must follow certain routines or has extreme reactions to small changes in routine.</li>
<li>Your child has obsessive or very unusual interests.</li>
<li>Your child has significant sensory aversions, like dislike of loud noises, dislike of how certain clothes fit or feel or very picky eating.</li>
<li>Your child has sensory-seeking behaviors, like looking out of the corner of their eye at objects (peering), sniffing or licking objects.</li>
</p>

<h2>How is autism treated?</h2>

<p>Autism treatment includes behavioral interventions or therapies. These teach new skills to address the core deficits of autism and reduce the core symptoms. Every child with autism is unique. For this reason, your child will receive an individualized treatment plan to meet their specific needs. It’s best to begin interventions as soon as possible so the benefits of therapy can continue throughout your child’s life.</p>

<p>Many people with ASD have additional medical conditions. These include gastrointestinal and feeding issues, seizures and sleep disturbances. Treatment can involve behavioral therapy, medications or both.</p>

<p>Early intensive behavioral treatments involve your entire family and possibly a team of professionals. As your child ages and develops, they may receive a modified treatment plan to cater to their specific needs.</p>

<p>During adolescence, children may benefit from transition services. These can promote skills of independence essential in adulthood. The focus at that point is on employment opportunities and job skill training.</p>

<h2>Can autism be prevented?</h2>

<p>You can’t prevent autism, but you can lower your risk of having a baby with the condition by taking certain steps, including:
<ul>
<li>Live a healthy lifestyle: Make sure you see your healthcare provider regularly, eat a nutritious diet and exercise. Get prenatal care, and take your provider’s recommended vitamins and supplements.</li>
<li>Take care with medications: Ask your healthcare provider which medications are safe and which you should stop taking during your pregnancy.</li>
<li>Don’t drink: No kind and no amount of alcohol is safe during pregnancy.</li>
<li>Keep up with your vaccinations: Get all of your provider’s recommended vaccines, including the German measles (rubella) vaccine, before you get pregnant. This vaccine can prevent rubella-associated autism.</li>
</ul></p>
