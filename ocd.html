OCD is usually a life-long (chronic) condition, but symptoms can come and go over time.

Everyone experiences obsessions and compulsions at some point. For example, it s common to occasionally double-check the stove or the locks. People also often use the phrases  obsessing  and  obsessed  very casually in everyday conversations. But OCD is more extreme. It can take up hours of a person s day. It gets in the way of normal life and activities. Obsessions in OCD are unwanted, and people with OCD don t enjoy performing compulsive behaviors.</p>
<h2>What are the symptoms of OCD?</h2>

<li>The obsessions or compulsions cause distress or affect your participation in social activities, work responsibilities or other life events.</li>
<li>The symptoms aren t caused by substances, alcohol, medications or another medical condition.</li>
<li>The symptoms aren t explained by a different mental health condition, such as generalized anxiety disorder, eating disorder or body image disorder.</li></ul>
